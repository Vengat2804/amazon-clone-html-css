# amazon-clone-html-css
This project is a static UI clone of the Amazon homepage, created using pure HTML5 and CSS3. It was built as a personal front-end development exercise to explore layout design, responsive elements, and e-commerce-inspired interfaces. No frameworks or JavaScript were usedâ€”just clean, semantic HTML and modern CSS.
